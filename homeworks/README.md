#Applied Machine Learning Assignments
Here are the homework assignments we did in the class, they are independent on the project but I added to the repo for u Diana.
The assignments are SUPER helpful in showing features in common ML tools that I didn't know about.  Unfortenuetly, I could only find copies of the assignments that I completed and not orriginal ones, but they should still be really helpful in discovering features and usages of ML tools
